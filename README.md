# Financial Statement Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and experiments for extracting, analyzing, and structuring financial data from PDF documents and scanned images. The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of document analysis, from classic table extraction to advanced layout analysis and LLM-powered workflows.

## Project Structure

- **llm_structure_analysis/**  
  End-to-end pipeline for detecting and extracting financial tables from PDFs using local Large Language Models (LLMs) via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).  
  - Detects pages containing financial tables.
  - Extracts structured data (title, period, currency, headers, line items, etc.) into JSON.
  - Utilizes multimodal LLMs (e.g., Gemma3) for both detection and extraction.
  - See [llm_structure_analysis/README.md](llm_structure_analysis/README.md) for detailed workflow, setup, and memory considerations.

- **python_structure_analysis/**  
  Experiments with various open-source Python libraries for table extraction from PDFs.  
  - Compares PyMuPDF, Camelot, Tabula-py, PyMuPDF4LLM, and Unstructured.
  - Highlights strengths and limitations of each approach.
  - Useful for benchmarking and understanding non-LLM extraction methods.
  - See [python_structure_analysis/README.md](python_structure_analysis/README.md) for features, prerequisites, and observations.

- **ocr_analysis/**  
  Pipeline for document layout analysis using OCR data.  
  - Detects tables, extracts text and bounding boxes using PaddleOCR.
  - Analyzes layout to identify columns, rows, and spanning elements.
  - Visualizes each stage of the analysis for debugging and understanding.
  - See [ocr_analysis/README.md](ocr_analysis/README.md) for module breakdown, workflow, and setup instructions.

- **resources/**  
  Contains sample images, workflow diagrams, and result visualizations referenced in the documentation.

- **output/**  
  Stores extracted tables, intermediate results, and visualizations generated by the scripts.

## Key Technologies

- Python 3.x
- PyMuPDF, Camelot, Tabula-py, Unstructured, PaddleOCR
- Ollama (for running local LLMs)
- Multimodal LLMs (e.g., Gemma3)
- Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, NumPy)

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a module** based on your use case:
   - For LLM-based extraction: see `llm_structure_analysis/`
   - For classic table extraction: see `python_structure_analysis/`
   - For OCR and layout analysis: see `ocr_analysis/`

2. **Follow the setup instructions** in the respective module's README.

3. **Run the provided scripts or notebooks** to process your documents.

## Example Use Cases

- Automate extraction of financial tables from annual reports.
- Benchmark and compare different table extraction libraries.
- Analyze and visualize the layout of scanned financial documents.
- Structure extracted data for downstream analysis or database storage.

## Notes

- Some modules require external dependencies (e.g., Ghostscript, Java, Ollama, PaddleOCR). See individual READMEs for details.
- This project is under active development!!
