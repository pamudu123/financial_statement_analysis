**INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT**

**TO THE MEMBERS OF B & E FOODS PTY LTD**

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Report**

**Opinion**

We have audited the general purpose financial report of B & E Foods Pty Ltd (the Company), which
comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023, the statement of comprehensive
income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended,
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and the
director s declaration.

In our opinion, the accompany financial report of the Company, is in accordance with the Corporations
Act 2001, including:

(a) giving a true and fair view of the Company 30 June 2023 and of its
financial performance for the year then ended; and

(b) complying with Australian Accounting Standards - Simplified Disclosure and the Corporations
Regulations 2001.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under

Report section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the auditor
independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the

Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the
financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporation Act 2001, which has been
given to the director of B & E Foods Pty Ltd, would be the same terms if given to the director as at the

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.

**Responsibilities of the Director for the Financial Report**

The director of B & E Foods Pty Ltd is responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001
and for such internal control as the director determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the director is responsible for assessing the Company
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the director either intend to liquidate the Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free

our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

          - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

          - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company

          - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the director.

          - Conclude on the appropriateness of the director s use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company

to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our

report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going

concern.

          - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.

         Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the financial report. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the director regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
